# EDA-python
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

This project focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand, clean, and analyze a real-world dataset. The goal is to extract meaningful insights, identify patterns, handle missing values, and visualize trends that support data-driven decision-making.

EDA is a crucial first step in the data science pipeline, and this project demonstrates practical skills in data cleaning, statistical analysis, and visualization.

Python
Pandas – data manipulation and analysis
NumPy – numerical operations
Matplotlib – data visualization
Jupyter Notebook – analysis environment
